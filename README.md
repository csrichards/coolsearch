Cool Search

In Google Chrome, some search fields, including Reddit's, will display a dropdown list of previous searches when the search field is selected.
There is no setting in Chrome that prevents the dropdown list from displaying.
When the Reddit search field is selected, a Reddit-specific dropdown also appears below the search field that allows users to select search options such as "limit search to ...", "include NSFW results", and "advanced search". Reddit's dropdown and Chrome's dropdown are hidden when the user de-selects the search field.
Chrome's dropdown covers Reddit's search dropdown, preventing users from selecting the search options.

Cool Search allows Reddit's dropdown to display when the search field is not selected, allowing users to select search options before Chrome's dropdown gets in their way.
Cool Search is useful for people browsing old.reddit.com on Google Chrome. That's about it.
